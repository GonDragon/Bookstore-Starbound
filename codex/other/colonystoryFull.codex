    "Last summer was one of the wettest I'd seen in the Rana Esker VI forest region. I only came out there for coffee (gotta have them fresh forest beans), and after one too many snaunts in the pouring rain I was ready to go back to bed. I could see a small dilapidated shack on the hilltop, so I began to trudge up there. It wasn't so bad when I reached it, there was even a sleeping bag and the remnants of an old campfire, obviously a popular spot for soggy, exhausted adventurers such as myself.",
	
	"In the morning I was greeted by a spectacular view of the sunrise over the dense forest canopy far below. I figured this little shack could be of use to others who find themselves lost in the woods like me, so I set about removing the overgrowth and replacing some rotten beams to fill the gaps in the walls and floors. It quickly became a much larger renovation project, and I took up semi-permanent residence there for a time. That little shack began to feel like a veritable home from home for me, so I decided it deserved a tenant.",
	
	"I'd met a Frogg merchant who'd set up shop on the Outpost selling furniture, he'd told me to come back to him if I ever wanted to try my hand at intergalactic real estate. So I planted a flag and hopped over there in my ship to see him. 

He sold me a \"Colony Deed\" and told me to place it on the wall. Provided the house was well lit, furnished and structurally sound, an ad would be sent out and a suitable tenant would immediately take up residence.",

"I was sceptical at first, but sure enough after filling the shack with furniture I'd looted from a Floran village (what can I say, I'm a sucker for the sticks 'n' bones aesthetic) I placed the deed on the wall and a complete stranger beamed right to where I was standing. 

And so began my long and arduous relationship with the Floran known as Ambiri.",

"For a Floran, Ambiri seems to like water a great deal. He's always opening the doors when it's raining and running outside. 

Yesterday I came home to a flood in the basement where Ambiri had decided to dry off next to my furnace after getting particularly soaked. Good job I reinforced the walls with tomb stone bricks. 

Maybe he would appreciate a fish tank?",

"One lesson I've learnt as a landlord: don't give a Floran bongos! They will play them night and day, and if you try to take them away when they are sleeping they will definitely know it was you. 

Ambiri isn't all bad to have around though, you can't fault his craftsmanship with plants. Although, I did expect more than salves as rent when I entered into this agreement.",

"After some time, Ambiri began asking me for favours. It started small, growing the odd vegetable and cooking dishes occasionally. I was happy to oblige, and even built a small farm next to the house for convenience. 

I very much enjoyed those warm autumn evenings we shared on the veranda by a crackling campfire. One evening, Ambiri announced that he would like to join me on my adventures and see the universe for himself.", 

"I was surprised, as he had shown no prior interest in leaving the planet he had come to call home. It must have been all the exciting tales I told every time I came to collect the rent and check up on the leafy little guy.

I'd grown fond of him, so I accepted his offer. He's been a medic on my ship ever since, even coming into the field with me from time to time. He still gets sick when he uses a teleporter, but we're working on that."
