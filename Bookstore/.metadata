  "description" : "Adds a new bookstore to the Outpost.\n\nThis mod is intended to being use as a framework, a kind of \"Tabula Rasa\" for codex entries, where other moders could put it's own books, and create it's own categories. A lot of mods add books to the game, some of them are manuals of how his mod works, other are lore of the new species and races that they introduce to the game, and other are just silly stories to add some fun content to the game. All the moders that adds this kind of content should face one problem: How I give my books to the player?\n\nSome of them have his own \"outpost\", where they could put shops and bookshelf with the books, but not always they can put all his books there, and not everyone could made his own \"outpost\". Others find some unimmersive ways, like make the book just appears in the ship of the player. Finally, others just let the job to the luck, and let the books appear as a \"loot\" in some dungeons.\n\nThis mod, is a non obligatory alternative of that. What that means? That means that, the moder could make a patch to put his books on the bookstore and, if the user do not have this mod, then nothing happends and everything is fine... but if the user have this mod, then he could go to the outpost and buy the books. This mod is also very versatile, you could useit and, if not like it, uninstall it, whitout any problems.\n\nAlso, I don't want to publish just an empty canvas, so there are in sale some of the stock books on the bookstore (one for each race), the colony deed manual, and one story compilated in one tome.\n\n\nBut the books have more than one use, so... What are books usefull for?\nShare lore and instructions are the mos common use of the books, but they are also ussefull for other thing. The books are great for starting quests: You could put a book as a loot, a book that tells the legend of a misterious planet full of pixels... But if the player don't have the patience of looking for the book trough the universe, he could just go to the bookstore, and buy it. They also are a good way to guide the player into a particular way: while there are not a formal quest, a book could say things about new planets, biomes, creatures and buildings, where find it and what you could expect as a prize for found it. Even some mistery quest, sub-plot o mysteri history, that starts as a frase on a book, and end in a formal quest. Even, you could add info about the updates of your mod as \"News\" from a newspaper (\"new discoveries in one matter\", \"there are a new gun rounding the world\", etc), codex entries that you could just simply erase from your mod when they become old. Finally, the books are a good way to learn new recipes, as \"How in the world that floran learn to build that computer?... Eassy, floran buyss a sschematicss at the Booksstore\".\n\nSo, I realease this tools for you. The use that you're going to give it, is it in your hands.\n\n[b]For Moders:[/b] If you want to learn how to add a book or a tab to the bookstore, it's pretty easy, just check the instructions at [url=https://github.com/GonDragon/Bookstore-Starbound/wiki/Instructions]github[/url].\n\nP.S.: I want to give a special thank to v6ooo, as I made the interface of the bookstore using his \"Many Tabs\" mod as a base. I encourage the use of that mod, it's pretty usefull.",
